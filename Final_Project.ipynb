    "The purpose of this Data Science Project is to perform an analysis to answer a predictive question using the Minecraft server, PlaiCraft, dataset. Specifically, we'd like to better understand the details regarding player engagement and demographics. This dataset was collected by a research group in Computer Science at UBC to explore how people play video games. In this Project Planning Report, a brief data description, proposed question, exploratory data analysis and visualization will be presented along with a structured approach and plan.\n",
